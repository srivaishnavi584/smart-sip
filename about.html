            <h2>What is SIP?</h2>
            <p>SIP, or Systematic Investment Plan, is a method of investing in mutual funds in a disciplined manner. It allows investors to invest a fixed amount regularly, typically monthly or quarterly. SIP is a convenient and effective way to grow your wealth over time by taking advantage of market opportunities and mitigating risks.</p>
            <p>By automating your investments, SIP ensures consistency and removes the need for market timing, making it ideal for both beginners and experienced investors.</p>

        <section id="how-sip-works">
            <a class="anchor-link" id="how-sip-works-anchor"></a>
            <h2>How Does SIP Work?</h2>
            <p>SIP works by enabling you to invest a fixed amount in a mutual fund scheme at regular intervals. When you invest through SIP, you purchase units of the mutual fund based on its Net Asset Value (NAV) on the investment date. This process is called rupee-cost averaging, as it averages out the purchase cost of your investments over time.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the power of compounding helps your investments grow exponentially, as the returns generated are reinvested to earn more returns. This makes SIP an effective tool for achieving long-term financial goals.</p>
